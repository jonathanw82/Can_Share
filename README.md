Can share was spawned out of a love for beer with good friends, where once a month we would meet up at our local brewery, bring a can each of whatever style of beer, 
all have a sample each and give our opinions on taste, smell, mouth feel/ body, colour, can or bottle design and how the can/bottle feels in the touch. Is it a 
quality beer in a shoddy can or a shoddy beer in a quality can then after trying a few we do an overall rating of the beer we have sampled.

The site is directed at Beer lovers and hobbyists rather than businesses.

#### The users goals of this website are:
* Rate beers and create, update, and delete beers.
* Clearly displaying Can logo art and credentials.
* Easy to navigate.

#### Database MongoDB Atlas:
MongoDB was used for this project and PyMongo is used to interact with the database.

The database has a four collections named 'cansAndBottleInfo', 'ratings', type, and users.

## cansAndBottleInfo

| Field         | Type     | Description                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| \_id          | ObjectId | ID is auto-created by MongoDB              |
| name          | String   | Name of beer                               |
| brand         | String   | Brand of beer                              |
| beer_type     | ObjectId | Id of beer Type                            |
| abv           | String   | Alchohol by volume number                  |
| vegan         | String   | Is beer vegan                              |
| Hop_type      | String   | Types of hops                              |
| malts         | String   | Types of Malts used                        |
| average_price | String   | Types of hops                              |
| where_bought  | String   | Where the product is sold                  |
| image_url     | String   | link to image                              |
| review        | String   | Info about the beer                        |
| creator       | String   | Email of the user who added it             | 

I chose the fields above for simplicity so it was not difficult to fill out the form to add a beer. All
fields are required except things the user may not know, such as hops_type, malts  and whether the drink is vegan.
Most of the other fields are easily found on the product can or bottle.

## type

| Field         | Type     | Description                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| \_id          | ObjectId | ID is auto-created by MongoDB              |
| type          | String   | type of beer (EG stout, red, sour etc)     |

I decided to keep the beer type in a separate collection, using the type id as the cansAndBottleInfo collection 
type of beer, that way if an IPA ever changed its name, it would be easier to change the name in one collection 
and all with that id will automatically be changed. 


## ratings

| Field         | Type     | Description                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| \_id          | ObjectId | ID is auto-created by MongoDB              |
| userId        | String   | User email                                 |
| canId         | String   | Id of the can                              |
| rating        | String   | Either 1 or zero                           |

The userId is based on the session email, the canId the cansAndBottleInfo id and the rating keeping this separate from the 
cansAndBottleInfo was my decision in case I felt the feature was not working it could easly be removed 
protecting the core cansAndBottleInfo collection.

## users

| Field         | Type     | Description                                |
| :------------ | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| \_id          | ObjectId | ID is auto-created by MongoDB              |
| username      | String   | Name of user                               |
| email         | String   | Email address of user                      |
| password      | String   | Encrypted password of the user             |
| type          | String   | Type of user (EG user or admin)            |

I felt the login needed to be aa simple as possible hence keeping to only three bits of user data thay can add. 
The user type is added automatically behind the scenes.

## Defensive Design
 A main concern I had during development, was that any user could delete a can added by another user or spam the database.

For this version of the application I have a restriction that only the person logged in as admin can delete posts, while users can add and edit any post.

In future releases of the application I will put in a restriction so that the only user that can delete or edit a product is the user that created it, therefore stopping any malicious activity.

Currently the application only uses frontend data validation via the form field attributes (maximum of 300 characters in text areas, only accepting valid url, etc.).
This will limit the amount of data a user can enter, but a user could enter offensive text.

Eventually I intend to use backend data validation and possibly have posts be checked by an administrator before being added to the database. 



## Testing:
**Test:** Age warning modal pops up, button under 18? redirects current brower tab to google, Enter site clears modal so user as access to login.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Signup link on loginbox redirects to signup page

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Signup error checking, if the user trys to signup again with the same email a message will tell the user they are already signed up. 

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Password error checking, if user puts incorrect email or password a message lets them know.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** login as administator gives the user the delete buttons on beer cards.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** login as a standard user.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Add beer button takes user to add beer form, all fields, dropdowns and checkboxes that are required give feedback if incorrectly filled out, text areas are limited to 300 characters and links to help page open in separate browser windows.
 All buttons add adds the can to database and redirects to beer cellar, cancel takes user back to beer cellar.

**Result:** If the user adds a url to a massive image only the center of it will be visable, this was the only work round with out resizing the image as sometimes they will look squashed if constrained 
also if user addes a bad image url an alterantive image is selected using onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='/static/images/noimage.jpg this works but generates a 404 error in the console, in future releases 
of Can Share I will consider having a way the user can upload images to avoid this problem, other than that this page works as intended.

**Test:** Edit beer button takes user to edit beer page all fields dropdowns and checkboxes are predefined as per previouse entrys, links to help page open in separate browser windows.
 All buttons, done, updates the can data to database and redirects to beer cellar, cancel, takes user back to beer cellar.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Info button takes user to the respective product that is selected, image and infomation is displayed, back button redirects to beer cellar.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** If adding a vegan product, if the user checks the vegan option on the check box, a green vegan icon will appear on the top of image on card, if unchecked, it has a cross in the middle of the vegan icon.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Links on navigation bar, Can Share top left onclick takes user to the beer cellar page, from all pages or if not logged in back to the login box.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** All other links on navigation bar take the user to the respective pages.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Links on help page all working and redirect to new browser tabs.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Links on friends page all working and redirect to new browser tabs.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Logout takes user to the login page.

**Result:** No errors, works as intended.

**Test:** Full resposiveness testing for each page has been tested with Chrome development tools, a Samsung Tablet and Samsung phone.

**Result:** No errors, a couple of teaks were needed to box and font sizes that is now corrected and Works as intended.

### Deployment:
##### To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository:

Log into GitHub.
Then clone this project from GitHub:

Follow this link to the Project's GitHub repository https://github.com/jonathanw82/Can_Share
Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
Select clone with HTTPs, copy the clone URL for the repository.

In your local IDE open Git Bash Terminal.
Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
(git clone "https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY")
Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

Further reading and troubleshooting on cloning a repository from GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

##### Forking the repository.
If you would like to take a copy of this repository in its current state, this can be done by forking.

Follow this link to the Project's GitHub repository https://github.com/jonathanw82/Can_Share

From the menu items near the top of the page, select Fork.
On doing so the repository will be added to your own gitHub account. From there you can follow the deployment 
details as stated below. You will also be able to make any changes you require that will not affect the 
original master from the original repository.


##### How to deploy from Heroku
To deploy from Heroku, first sign up to do this go to https://www.heroku.com/
and click the sign up button on right hand side and fill out the form to create a new account,then select Python as the development language. 

At this point you will be sent a confirmation email, once the link in the email has been clicked you will be prompted to input a password and the account will be set up.

Once all setup and logged in, click on the create new app button, then give your project a name using hyphens instead of spaces. The name has to be unique as 
Heroku has thousands of apps and they cannot have the same name, select your region and select create app.

You will then be presented with a dashboard with listings of command lines for use in a bash command line.

From your workspace of choice open the command line and install Heroku depending on workspace, type (pip3 install heroku) once installed, type (heroku login -I)
then enter your email and password you set Heroku up with. It will then state you are logged in. 

We will now need to push our files to Heroku to be deployed or our live version.

To do this in Heroku go to the app you created earlier then select deploy, under app information you will see Heroku git URL copy the url, in the bash 
command line in the work space of choice type (heroku git:remote –a <app_name>) at this point you need to push all your data up to Heroku.

To do this from your git bash command line type (git add .) then (git commit –m “deploy to heroku”) then (git push –u heroku master ) this will take a few minutes to push all the data to 
Heroku. 

We then need to setup a web process to do this at the command prompt type (heroku ps:scale web=1) after this our web process will be running we will now need to set up some 
config Vars in heroku.

Go back to heroku go to settings click reveal config vars, there will be a few things to add here, first setup IP so in the box that says Key type (IP) and in 
the value box type (0.0.0.0) click add then do the same but type (PORT) and set that to (5000) click add. You will also need to add (MONGO_URI) and the (SECRET_KEY) for this information contact You site developer.

Once all the steps have been taken, click more top right hand side of page and select restart all dynos the application will now be deployed.

If a message pops up stating there may be some down time until the restart has finished click OK.

Under the settings tab in Heroku, scroll down to domains and your link will be displayed there. It can be used to access the live version of the application.

Deployment: The site will be deployed by 
https://www.heroku.com/
